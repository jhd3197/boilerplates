# Project Intent

## Purpose
Provide project intent and behavioral expectations for Antigravity and Google models.

## Scope
Model neutral guidance. No permissions. No Claude specific instructions.

## One Paragraph Project Summary
This is a minimal React embedded widget boilerplate built with Vite, designed for creating small, self-contained React components that can be integrated into larger applications or websites.

## What the Project is For
To serve as a starting template for building React embedded widgets, providing essential setup for development and building lightweight, embeddable UI components.

## Stability Guarantees
- Uses stable versions of React and Vite
- Minimal dependencies for lightweight embedding
- Simple component structure

## Data Contracts and Invariants
- Components expect standard React props
- File structure adheres to src/ with App.jsx, main.jsx, index.css
- Designed for embedding in external HTML

## Compatibility Expectations
- Compatible with modern browsers and Node.js 16+
- Follows web standards
- Minimal bundle size

## Risk Tolerance Level
Low - prefer minimal, proven libraries.

## What Changes are Considered Safe
- Adding new components or features
- Updating documentation
- Minor style adjustments
- Bug fixes in existing code

## What Changes Require Explicit Approval
- Adding new dependencies
- Major architectural changes
- Changing the embedding interface

## Non Goals
- Not intended for full applications
- Avoids routing or complex state management
- Not for server-side rendering

## Important Notes
Antigravity will also analyze README.md and other markdown documentation. This file clarifies intent, sets boundaries, and avoids duplicating documentation.

## Outcome
Antigravity builds a correct mental model of the project before acting.
