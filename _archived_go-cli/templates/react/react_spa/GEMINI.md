# Project Intent

## Purpose
Provide project intent and behavioral expectations for Antigravity and Google models.

## Scope
Model neutral guidance. No permissions. No Claude specific instructions.

## One Paragraph Project Summary
This is a modern React Single Page Application (SPA) boilerplate built with Vite, designed for rapid development of web applications with a clean structure, including components, pages, and routing.

## What the Project is For
To serve as a starting template for building React SPAs, providing essential setup for development, building, and deployment with best practices in mind.

## Stability Guarantees
- Uses stable versions of React and Vite
- Follows standard project structures
- Includes linting and formatting tools

## Data Contracts and Invariants
- Components expect standard React props
- File structure adheres to src/ with App.jsx, main.jsx, components/, pages/
- Environment variables prefixed with VITE_

## Compatibility Expectations
- Compatible with modern browsers and Node.js 16+
- Follows web standards

## Risk Tolerance Level
Low to medium - prefer proven libraries and avoid experimental features.

## What Changes are Considered Safe
- Adding new components or pages
- Updating documentation
- Minor style adjustments
- Bug fixes in existing code

## What Changes Require Explicit Approval
- Major architectural changes
- Upgrading major dependencies
- Restructuring folders
- Introducing new build tools

## Non Goals
- Not intended for server-side rendering
- Not a full-stack solution
- Avoids complex state management libraries by default

## Important Notes
Antigravity will also analyze README.md and other markdown documentation. This file clarifies intent, sets boundaries, and avoids duplicating documentation.

## Outcome
Antigravity builds a correct mental model of the project before acting.
