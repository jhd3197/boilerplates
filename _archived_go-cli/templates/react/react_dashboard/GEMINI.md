# Project Intent

## Purpose
Provide project intent and behavioral expectations for Antigravity and Google models.

## Scope
Model neutral guidance. No permissions. No Claude specific instructions.

## One Paragraph Project Summary
This is a modern React dashboard application boilerplate built with Vite, featuring routing, charts, and a sidebar layout for building data-driven web interfaces.

## What the Project is For
To serve as a starting template for building React dashboard applications, providing essential setup for development, building, and deployment with components for navigation, data visualization, and user management.

## Stability Guarantees
- Uses stable versions of React, Vite, and related libraries
- Follows standard project structures for dashboards
- Includes routing and layout components

## Data Contracts and Invariants
- Components expect standard React props
- File structure adheres to src/ with App.jsx, main.jsx, components/, layouts/, pages/
- Uses react-router-dom for routing
- Charts use Recharts library
- Icons from Lucide React

## Compatibility Expectations
- Compatible with modern browsers and Node.js 16+
- Follows web standards

## Risk Tolerance Level
Low to medium - prefer proven libraries and avoid experimental features.

## What Changes are Considered Safe
- Adding new components, layouts, or pages
- Updating documentation
- Minor style adjustments
- Bug fixes in existing code
- Adding new routes

## What Changes Require Explicit Approval
- Major architectural changes
- Upgrading major dependencies
- Restructuring folders
- Introducing new charting libraries
- Removing existing routes or components

## Non Goals
- Not intended for server-side rendering
- Not a full-stack solution
- Avoids complex state management libraries by default

## Important Notes
Antigravity will also analyze README.md and other markdown documentation. This file clarifies intent, sets boundaries, and avoids duplicating documentation.

## Outcome
Antigravity builds a correct mental model of the project before acting.
